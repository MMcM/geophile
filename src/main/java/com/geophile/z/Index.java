/**
 * An index used to contain {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialObject}s must implement this interface.
 *
 * When a {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialObject} is added to a {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialIndex},
 * records of the form ((z, id), s) are added to an Index. s is the spatial object.
 * The key, (z, id), comprises a z-value z, and the spatial object's id.
 * (The {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialIndex} is responsible for generating z-values and calling
 * {@link Index#add(long, com.geophile.z.SpatialObject)}.)
 *
 * Removal of a {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialObject} from a {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialIndex} is
 * done by calling {@link #remove(long, long)} for each z-value of the {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialObject}.
 * In order to completely remove a {@link com.geophile.z.SpatialObject}, the same z-values must be provided
 * as when the object was added.
 *
 * An index that does "blind updates" cannot detect duplicate keys, and cannot indicate whether a removal succeeds.
 * An index with these behaviors is indicated by {@link #blindUpdates()}.
 *
 * Access to Index contents is accomplished using a {@link Cursor}, obtained by
 * {@link Index#cursor(long)}.
